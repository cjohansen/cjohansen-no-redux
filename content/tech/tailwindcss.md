[P√• norsk](https://parenteser.mattilsynet.io/tailwindcss/).

Let‚Äôs just get it out of the way: Congratulations! Welcome to the party, etc.
Yes, [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) is old, but the future is, as we
know, [unevenly
distributed](https://quoteinvestigator.com/2012/01/24/future-has-arrived/).

Today, we launched a [static page](https://magnars.com/static-sites/) to replace
an older service, [Smilefjesplakater online](https://smilefjes.mattilsynet.no/).
Since the [solution](https://github.com/mattilsynet/smilefjes-deux) is small, we
saw it as a good opportunity to take a minor technical risk and learn something
new. So we decided to build the interface using Tailwind CSS, even though none
of us had used it before.

## What is Tailwind?

Tailwind is a CSS framework. Ideally, you don‚Äôt write any CSS yourself, but
instead use Tailwind‚Äôs [utility
classes](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/installation), such as `py-8` (8 units of
vertical padding, i.e. top and bottom), `hover:text-bold` (bold text on hover),
`flex` (display flex), etc. It‚Äôs _almost_ inline CSS, but with class names ‚Äî
which gives you access to media queries, pseudo-classes, etc. In addition to a
huge library of such classes, Tailwind includes a build system that gives you a
CSS file with only the utilities you actually use.

[Nicole Sullivan‚Äôs
OOCSS](https://www.stubbornella.org/2009/03/23/object-oriented-css-video-on-ydn/)
taught me to love utility classes over 10 years ago, so not having to write them
manually all the time was an attractive proposition.

## The Good

Tailwind charmed from the start. Even though I asked it to watch some Clojure
files (which I doubted it would understand), the build process never once let me
down ‚Äî it always did what I wanted, and more. It‚Äôs fast, and once started, you
just forget about it. üëç

Tailwind has a system for generating utilities with and without various
modifiers ‚Äî a highly efficient tool for building layouts. I recently did [a
mobile adaptation of a
page](https://github.com/Mattilsynet/smilefjes-deux/commit/d3e034653de894d2a07d64d2af5ddb0b50212187),
which illustrates this strength well.

We started with this markup (expressed using Clojure data structures, also known
as [hiccup](https://github.com/weavejester/hiccup)):

```clj
[:div.flex.px-8.py-4
 [:div.max-w-72.py-4
  [:h2.text-lg.font-medium.mb-4
   "Alle smilefjes p√• ett sted"]
  [:p.mb-4
   "Et smilefjes fra Mattilsynet viser hvordan
    vi vurderer viktige forhold som hygiene,
    rengj√∏ring og vedlikehold p√• et spisested."]
  (icon-button
   {:icon icons/smilefjes
    :href "https://www.mattilsynet.no/mat-og-drikke/forbrukere/smilefjesordningen"}
   "Les mer om smilefjes")]
 [:div.max-w-full.py-4.w-full
  [:div.md:pl-16 (svg "/images/inspekt√∏r.svg")]]]
```

The key point here is that the outer `div` has `flex` so the two inner `div`s
are displayed side by side:

<img src="/images/inspektor-flex.png" class="img" alt="Side-by-side layout">

This doesn‚Äôt work so well on small screens. I needed to drop `flex` on small
screens and redistribute the padding a bit so things didn‚Äôt end up crammed
together. And I did that as follows:

- `flex` on the container became `md:flex`, which means: apply `flex` starting
  from the [predefined
  breakpoint](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/responsive-design) `md`.
- `p-8` on the container was replaced with `px-8` and `py-4`. That keeps the
  same horizontal padding, but halves the vertical.
- `py-4` on the two inner elements provides the same spacing on large screens,
  and also gives suitable vertical padding between the elements on smaller
  screens.
- `md:pl-16` on the SVG illustration, so it has left padding when it sits side
  by side with the text.

The whole task took me five minutes and was a real pleasure. Every possible
utility ‚Äúalready exists‚Äù ‚Äî you just use them. Tailwind makes sure that the CSS
file only contains what‚Äôs actually used. The result:

<img src="/images/inspektor-mobil.png" class="img" alt="Mobile layout">

As you can see hinted at above, Tailwind has a very nice system for
[spacing](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/customizing-spacing), and also for
[colors](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/customizing-colors).

## The Bad

Because Tailwind‚Äôs building blocks are so atomic, things quickly pile up when
you're building more complex components. Just look at this example ‚Äî can you
tell what it is?

```clj
[:a
 {:href "https://www.mattilsynet.no/mat-og-drikke/forbrukere/smilefjesordningen"
  :class ["flex" "items-center" "border" "rounded"
          "px-4" "py-2" "font-medium" "border-granskog-800"
          "border-2" "text-granskog-800"]}
 [:div.w-4.mr-2 icons/smilefjes]
 "Les mer om smilefjes"]
```

It's a button ‚Äî a fact that easily drowns in the visual clutter.

If you want to have two buttons in your codebase, you‚Äôre more or less forced to
either extract this into a function, or forever live with small inconsistencies
between your buttons. Keeping that class list identical in multiple places gets
messy fast ‚Äî and this is a fairly innocent example; hardened Tailwind users have
seen much worse.

I mentioned the spacing and color systems earlier. The color system is good, but
perhaps not in the way Tailwind encourages you to use it. It assumes you'll call
a blue spade "blue", and use class names like `border-blue-100`. Imagine you
have 1000 such classes across your codebase, and then the designer comes in with
a new theme. Ouch.

Tailwind does allow you to define your own colors, and the issue above is
trivially solved by giving those colors more ‚Äúsemantic‚Äù names, so instead you
can write `border-primary-100`.

## Semantics

Tailwind claims that semantic CSS doesn‚Äôt scale. At the same time, there are
Tailwind plugins/component systems like [DaisyUI](https://daisyui.com/) that
market themselves like this:

<img src="/images/daisy.png" alt="Instead of writing 100 class names, for every element, every page, every project, again and again... use semantic class names" class="img">

When these two tools seem to have such conflicting views on semantics, I suspect
they‚Äôre talking about different kinds of semantics. The semantics Tailwind wants
to eliminate are class names like `.book-search` and `.shopping-cart` ‚Äî i.e. CSS
classes named after your business domain. DaisyUI‚Äôs semantics are about [UI
components](https://daisyui.com/components/) ‚Äî things like buttons, tabs, and
links.

Finding the [right domain](/domain-frontend/) is as hard as it is important ‚Äî
feel free to check out [my talk](https://vimeo.com/861600197) for more on that
topic.

## Conclusion

[As
expected](https://github.com/Mattilsynet/smilefjes-deux/blob/main/adr/04-css.md),
our first implementation using Tailwind turned into a bit of a mess. But we‚Äôve
learned a lot, and we now have a clear idea of how we want to use it moving
forward.

I probably won‚Äôt base an entire site solely on Tailwind again. For my taste, it
ends up being too much detail and too low a level of abstraction. It has to be
combined with a component library ‚Äî I need to be able to call a button a `btn`.
Personally, I believe in something that plays well with Tailwind, like DaisyUI.
That‚Äôll be the next adventure.
